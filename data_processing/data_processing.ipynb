The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is composed of women and men who seek their personal holiness through works of charity. In this essential way, the Society differs from charitable associations or agencies whose principal objective is not the spiritual advancement of their members but the doing of good for someone else. The Society's nearly 100,000 trained volunteers in the United States provided 12.6 million hours of volunteer service in 2017, helping more than 5.4 million people through visits to homes, prisons and hospitals at a value of more than $3 billion dollars.\",\n",

Since 1967, Circle Of Concern has served west St. Louis County with our food pantry, financial assistance, scholarships and other programs. In the pantry, we are committed to providing both canned/boxed nonperishable food AND fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, eggs, cheese and some meat. Financial assistance meets critical needs to avert an eviction or to keep the utilities on. Scholarships help young people go to college and help adult clients gets critical job training and certifications; in both cases, they are a step toward breaking the cycle of poverty. Holiday programs such as Thanksgiving Baskets, Holiday Family Adoption and Toy Day ease expenses during that joyful time of year. With these programs - and more - Circle is committed to helping our neighbors-in-need so they can direct their own resources toward rebuilding their financial foundations.\",\n",

This research has important implications for non-diabetics as well since we have discovered great similarities between the vascular damage caused by diabetes and damage to arteries and blood vessels that leads to heart attacks and strokes in non-diabetics.\",\n",

The Center moved to its current location at 31st and Troost in 1981. Since that time, it has added a broad range of social services to meet the needs of the children and their families and in 2006 completed a $13 million facility expansion that increased our licensed capacity. Today, we serve 290 children (0-5 years) in our Early Childhood Education program; 140 school-age children (5 - 13 years) in Before/After-School and Summer programming; and the children's 250+ parents through a broad range of support services.\",\n",

As the crack cocaine epidemic gripped our community, the founders of the Coalition saw children languish for years in foster care. They believed in a different future, one in which no child grew up without the love and support of a family. Today, with 30 years of experience in system change and grassroots advocacy, combined with undiminished passion, their vision remains: \\\"For Every Child \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 A Place to Call Home.\\\" Recognized by the New York Times and TIME Magazine for its groundbreaking and data-driven work in foster care and adoption, The Coalition is our region's leader in responding to the opioid epidemic that currently threatens our most vulnerable children. To help create permanency in every child's life, The Coalition focuses on two areas: 1) finding and training more qualified; and 2) providing support to families so they can meet these children's elevated needs.\",\n",

LBT believes that no language or cultural barrier should prevent people from having access to God's Word.
